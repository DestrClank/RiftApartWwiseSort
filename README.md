# RiftApartWwiseSort 
This program sorts and rename .wem files extracted with the [Modding Tools](https://github.com/Tkachov/Overstrike) accordingly by looking at the extracted names generated by these [scripts](https://github.com/PythonBlue/racra-wwise).
It was made for finding the music related files out of all .wem files and for Ratchet & Clank : Rift Apart.

## Usage (for music extraction)

- Use the [Usage Extraction](https://github.com/PythonBlue/racra-wwise?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-extraction) guide to create the folder containing the needed informations to sort and rename the .wem files.
  - Note : to get only the music, the soundbank is `music.soundbank`. Type at `Filter only a specific soundbank(s)` the filter `music`.
  - The script will make a folder named `extracted` at the root of the script folder, inside of it, a sub-folder named `music` will be present, this will be used by the program. 
- Download, extract the [Modding Tools](https://github.com/Tkachov/Overstrike/releases/download/MT%2Fv1.4.4/ModdingTool_v1.4.4.zip) and run `ModdingTools.exe`.
- Upon launch, go to `File > Load toc` and select the `toc` file stored inside of your Ratchet & Clank game folder.
  - Steam location (by default) : `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RatchetClank`
  - Epic Games location (by default) : `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RatchetClank`
- On the left side, select `WEM` and extract all the .wem files stored in `wem_0`, `wem_00` and `wem_1` in a folder.
- Then with RiftApartWwiseSort, use this command to sort and rename the music.
```
RiftApartWwiseSort <path of the "extracted\music" folder> <path of the wem folder> output
```
